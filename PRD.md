# Product Requirements Document – Markdown Clipboard Converter

## 1. Summary
A Chrome browser extension that converts rich-text clipboard content into clean Markdown. Users paste formatted content (e.g., from Google Docs, web pages, or email clients) and immediately receive Markdown that is ready to paste into documentation, wikis, or developer tools.

## 2. Goals & Non-Goals
- **Goals**
  - Provide a fast, reliable way to convert HTML clipboard content into Markdown.
  - Offer a simple popup UI that works without leaving the current tab.
  - Preserve semantic formatting (headings, lists, tables, code blocks) whenever possible.
  - Automatically copy the converted Markdown back to the clipboard for a frictionless workflow.
- **Non-Goals**
  - Editing Markdown within the extension.
  - Hosting or syncing conversions in the cloud.
  - Supporting browsers other than Chromium-based (initially).

## 3. Target Users & Use Cases
- **Markdown-first writers** creating docs for GitHub, Notion, or internal wikis.
- **Engineers** pasting specs or meeting notes from formatted sources into Markdown repos.
- **Support teams** capturing knowledge-base drafts from web editors.

Primary use cases:
1. Convert formatted meeting notes to Markdown for a GitHub issue.
2. Paste styled emails into Markdown without manual cleanup.
3. Migrate Google Docs snippets into Markdown documentation effortlessly.

## 4. User Stories
- _As a_ technical writer, _I want_ to paste formatted text into the popup _so that_ I instantly get Markdown that I can paste into my docs.
- _As a_ developer, _I want_ the extension to copy the generated Markdown back to my clipboard automatically _so that_ I can share it in chat or commit messages.
- _As a_ privacy-conscious user, _I want_ all processing to stay local _so that_ I know my clipboard never leaves my machine.

## 5. Functional Requirements
1. **Paste & Convert button** reads the clipboard and converts HTML to Markdown using Turndown.
2. **Keyboard paste support** listens for `Cmd/Ctrl + V` within the popup and performs the same conversion.
3. **Auto-copy on success** writes the newly generated Markdown back to the clipboard immediately after conversion.
4. **Clear output** button removes the current Markdown and resets the status message.
5. **Status messaging** communicates success or actionable errors (e.g., missing permissions, empty clipboard).
6. **Permissions flow** requests `clipboardRead` and `clipboardWrite` permissions on demand.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Conversion should complete within 200 ms for typical clipboard payloads (<200 KB HTML).
- **Reliability**: Gracefully fall back to plain text when HTML is unavailable.
- **Security & Privacy**: Never transmit clipboard contents off-device; operate entirely within the extension context.
- **Accessibility**: Buttons should be keyboard accessible with focus styles and ARIA status updates.
- **Internationalization readiness**: UI text centralized for easy localization in future iterations.

## 7. Success Metrics
- Time-to-convert: <1 second for 95% of conversions.
- Copy success rate: >98% after granting permissions.
- Repeat usage rate: ≥60% of active users trigger the auto-copy workflow at least twice per week.
- Error rate: <5% of conversions result in an error message.

## 8. Release Plan
1. **Alpha (internal)**: Validate clipboard read/write permissions and Markdown fidelity with core workflows.
2. **Beta (friendly users)**: Gather feedback on formatting accuracy and UI clarity.
3. **1.0 Launch**: Publish to Chrome Web Store with production branding and documentation.

## 9. Risks & Mitigations
- **Clipboard API variability**: Some environments block `navigator.clipboard.read`. Provide fallback to plain text and clear messaging.
- **Markdown fidelity gaps**: Turndown may miss edge cases (e.g., complex tables). Allow users to review output and iterate quickly.
- **Permission friction**: Users may deny clipboard access. Surface retry guidance and link to Chrome permission settings.

## 10. Open Questions
- Should we offer additional output formats (e.g., HTML → JSON)?
- Is offline documentation or onboarding necessary within the popup?
- Do we need advanced configuration (e.g., custom Turndown rules) in v1 or later?
