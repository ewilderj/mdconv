# Privacy Policy - Markdown Clipboard Converter

*Last updated: September 27, 2025*

## Overview

Markdown Clipboard Converter is a browser extension that converts rich text content into Markdown format. This privacy policy explains how the extension handles data and protects your privacy.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data.**

The Markdown Clipboard Converter extension:
- Does not collect any personal information
- Does not track user behavior or usage patterns
- Does not store any data on external servers
- Does not use analytics or tracking services
- Does not require user accounts or registration

## Local Data Processing

### Clipboard Access
The extension requests clipboard permissions to:
- Read formatted content (HTML) and plain text from your clipboard
- Write converted Markdown back to your clipboard

**Important:** All clipboard processing happens entirely on your local device. No clipboard content is ever transmitted to external servers or third parties.

### Text Selection Processing
When using the "Copy as Markdown" context menu feature:
- The extension processes the selected text locally within your browser
- Selected content is converted to Markdown on your device
- No selected text is transmitted to external servers or third parties

### Local Storage
The extension does not store any data locally on your device. Each conversion is processed in real-time without persistence.

## Permissions Explained

The extension requests the following permissions:

### Required Permissions
- **clipboardRead**: To read formatted content from your clipboard for conversion
- **clipboardWrite**: To copy converted Markdown back to your clipboard
- **contextMenus**: To add the "Copy as Markdown" option to right-click menus
- **scripting**: To process selected text on web pages for context menu conversion

### Host Permissions
- **<all_urls>**: Required to enable the context menu feature on any website you visit

**Note:** The extension only processes content when you explicitly trigger a conversion (button click or context menu selection). It does not automatically access or process content from websites you visit.

## Third-Party Services

This extension does not use any third-party services, APIs, or external connections. All functionality operates entirely within your browser.

## Data Security

Since no data is collected, stored, or transmitted:
- There are no servers to secure
- There are no databases to protect

- Your content never leaves your device

## Browser Data

- Access other extensions or browser data
- Modify files on your computer

- Interact with other websites beyond the conversion functionality

## Children's Privacy

This extension does not collect any data from users of any age. It is safe for use by children as no personal information is processed or collected.

## International Users
